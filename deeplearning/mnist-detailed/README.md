# MNIST Keras Solution: Explaination with CNN Explainer #

## Understand MNIST problem and its CNN solution using CNN Explainer ##

Do you still strggle to understand the classing MNIST problem and the implementation of its solution using a simple CNN, i.e. without using any other transfer learning? If yes, this tutorial is for you. 

In this tutorial, I have taken the MNIST solution as created by Keras team and explained it using CNN Exaplainer so those who have difficulty to understand MNIST problem and its solution, can have better understanding about it.

MNIST is the classic deep learning neural network problem for anyone to understand convolutional neural networks. The solution in this tutorial is classic Keras base CNN model with almost 99% accuracy to solve MNIST hand written digits recognition problem. 

After the tutorial, you will be able to create your own network to solve your own image classification problem by adopting the MNIST CNN and experiment it, modify it to find the solution to your own problem. 

This video is design for the beginners who are starting their journey into Deep learning and neural networks.
