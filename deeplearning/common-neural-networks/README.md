## Various types of Neural Networks ##

### Lets define some of the common neural networks and create them ###

### CNN - Convolution Neural Network ###
The convolutional-neural-network is a subclass of neural-networks which have at least one convolution layer. 
- They are great for capturing local information (e.g. neighbor pixels in an image or surrounding words in a text)
- Reducing the complexity of the model - faster training, needs fewer samples, reduces the chance of overfitting)
